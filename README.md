## Description
A website in development meant to visualize enrollment statistics for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign by race. Inspired by Dave Musselman's Unessay assignment (IS 308, SP23).

CSVs in `data/` fetched from https://www.dmi.illinois.edu/ through `scripts/`.

Heavily powered by Chart.Js
## TODO:
- Description / Motivations box for landing page 
- Add more years (possibly back to 2000?) depending on data
