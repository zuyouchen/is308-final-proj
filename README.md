# is308-final-proj
## Description
A website in development meant to visualize enrollment statistics for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign by race. Inspired by Dave Musselman's Unessay assignment (IS 308, SP23).

CSVs in `data/` fetched from https://www.dmi.illinois.edu/ through `scripts/`.

Heavily powered by Chart.Js
## TODO:
-  Additional page with cumulative statistics (across all colleges, across years (line graph))
    - Generate this data (Python)
    - Generate the page (index.html) 
- [half done] Landing page for the website (description, buttons leading to the pages)
