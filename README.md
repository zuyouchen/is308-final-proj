# is308-final-proj
## Description
A website in development meant to visualize enrollment statistics for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign by race. Inspired by Dave Musselman's Unessay assignment (IS 308, SP23).

CSVs in `data/` fetched from https://www.dmi.illinois.edu/ through `scripts/`.

Heavily powered by Chart.Js

-  work in progress - Additional page with cumulative statistics (across all colleges, across years (line graph))
    - Main line chart can be total population of [undergrad, grad, both] students across the years 2017 - 2023
    - Generate this data `scripts/dev_cumulative.ipynb`
